0,"This story begins with an end. In March 1991, after a three-month stay at Dr Bharat Vatwani’s Shraddha Nursing Home in Mumbai, Gangadhar Vinode, then 17, returned to his village near Wakad, in Pune. Earlier that year, the schizophrenic was found lying by a drain in Mumbai and had been picked up by staffers of Missionaries of Charity.
When Dr Vatwani, who used to help the Missionaries of Charity with their work, saw him at the centre, he decided to take him under his wing. “He was not in good shape; I told them I wanted to try and cure him,” Dr Vatwani says. Towards the end of his stay at the nursing home, Vinode provided Dr Vatwani his address in Wakad, and the doctor rode down to Pune to inform his parents about their son. The next day, Vinode’s parents and grandfather arrived at the nursing home with tons of sweets, performed an aarti for Dr Vatwani, and left with their son.
Vinode, who has a shy smile and a childlike excitement, has just completed his third housing project in Pune. After being successfully treated by Dr Vatwani, he resolutely got back to work on his family’s farm, set up a brick kiln and a service centre for cars before eventually moving into construction about six years ago. He says he has no recollection of what happened to him that winter 27 years ago. All the 46-year-old wrestling buff remembers is going to Kolhapur to spend some time at an akhara, and preparing to return after a month there.
“I had boarded a bus bound for Pune, but somehow I found myself in doctor sir’s nursing home,” says Vinode. “Since then, it’s been God, my parents and Dr Vatwani.” His colleague, Lawrence Fernandes, and nephew Vishal Wakadkar, say they still find it tough to believe that “Ganga bhau”, who co-runs Vinode Constructions, once roamed the streets oblivious to everything.
But Dr Vatwani has been battling the odds since he was a child. After his father, a high ranking government official, died an untimely death, he and his brothers, who were then still in school, sold photos of movie stars to their classmates, and books and gramophone records to the residents of Bandra, where they lived, to make ends meet. He would ring the doorbell, say he was hard up, and offer his wares.
He has been on the other side as well. About a decade after he started his nursing home along with wife Smita, he slipped into severe depression when his desire for a bigger set-up met with resistance from locals and was mired in a court case. The courts eventually ruled in his favour, but it was a meeting with the late social activist Baba Amte in the 1990s that changed his life.
Dr Vatwani was driving down to Hemalkasa, in Gadchiroli, where the Amtes worked among the Madia Gond tribe, when he spotted a mentally ill man, his hands and feet bound in chains, walking by the road. He coaxed him to come with him in the car.
“That was how I first met Baba Amte and Prakash (Amte’s son). I landed up there with an unwashed, bedraggled man in chains, and told them we needed to get those chains off.” Prakash Amte, says Dr Vatwani, took a hammer and started striking the links in the chains. The next morning, Dr Vatwani found Baba Amte crying.
“He said he empathised with the plight of wandering mentally ill people, but had never been able to do anything for them. He said while I was doing good work, it was not enough. He said I was ‘chosen’, and that fired me up,” says Dr Vatwani, who set up the 120-bed Shraddha Rehabilitation Foundation, in Karjat, in 2006, and has since then helped people from across the country reunite with themselves and their families.
He is also aware of his advancing age, and hopes that the Magsaysay award will help him find people whom he can hand the baton over to. “I’m pushing 60, how long can I keep up with this? If it can get more NGOs, bureaucrats and society to talk about the mentally ill destitute, that would be good, especially in a country where religion and black magic are still supposed to cure mental illness. If it were not for his family’s support, Vinode would have taken much longer to be the man he is today.” Baba Amte, says Dr Vatwani, ignited the spark in him, and now he is looking for others with the “same spark”.
Today, many of his former patients, including Vinode, regularly donate funds to NGOs and organisations involved in mental health care, and each time he spots a mentally-ill destitute, Vinode makes it a point to bring him home and bathe him, or if he is violent, call up local organisations to take care of the person. It might be the glimmer of a beginning, but it is a beginning all the same.
