Passage: Star Wars: Episode VII Offering Role To Jonathan Rhys Meyers?
Now that Star Trek Into Darkness is out in the world and racking up cash, it's safe to turn our attention to where director J.J. Abrams will boldly go next, which is of course Star Wars: Episode VII. The amount of actual confirmed information is vastly outweighed by endless rumors, and now we've got another unconfirmed report to add to the pile. The scoopsters at Latino Review, who have been busy digging up info on the new Star Wars production, say that an offer is out to Jonathan Rhys Meyers to take a starring role in the film?
Who will he play? No telling. Will Abrams or anybody confirm it? Don't count on it. But Meyers makes as much sense for a role in the film as anybody else, having played a role in Abrams's own Mission: Impossible III, and making his name as the star of The Tudors and in movies like Match Point, From Paris With Love and Bend It Like Beckham. On the other hand he's the lead character in Dracula, the new drama just picked up by NBC for its fall schedule. TV stars take time off for their movie careers all the time, but a role in the new Star Wars movie isn't exactly the kind of thing you can knock out in a monthlong hiatus. Rhys Meyers is a talented and fascinating actor, but is a production as big as Star Wars: Episode VII willing to work around Dracula?",0,Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B,Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B,Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B,gpt-5.1
