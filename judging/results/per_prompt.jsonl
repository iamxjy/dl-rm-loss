Santa is booting up his weather machine; looks like you might get a white Christmas after all.\n\nThe weather machine beeps! On the console of the machine is a copy protection message asking you to enter a code from the instruction manual. Apparently, it refuses to run unless you give it that code. No problem; you'll just look up the code in the--\n\n\"Ho ho ho\", Santa ponders aloud. \"I can't seem to find the manual.\"\n\nYou look up the support number for the manufacturer and give them a call. Good thing, too - that 49th star wasn't going to earn itself.\n\n\"Oh, that machine is quite old!\", they tell you. \"That model went out of support six minutes ago, and we just finished shredding all of the manuals. I bet we can find you the code generation algorithm, though.\"\n\nAfter putting you on hold for twenty minutes (your call is very important to them, it reminded you repeatedly), they finally find an engineer that remembers how the code system works.\n\nThe codes are printed on an infinite sheet of paper, starting in the top-left corner. The codes are filled in by diagonals: starting with the first row with an empty first box, the codes are filled in diagonally up and to the right. This process repeats until the infinite paper is covered. So, the first few codes are filled in in this order:\n\n   | 1   2   3   4   5   6  \n---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n 1 |  1   3   6  10  15  21\n 2 |  2   5   9  14  20\n 3 |  4   8  13  19\n 4 |  7  12  18\n 5 | 11  17\n 6 | 16\nFor example, the 12th code would be written to row 4, column 2; the 15th code would be written to row 1, column 5.\n\nThe voice on the other end of the phone continues with how the codes are actually generated. The first code is 20151125. After that, each code is generated by taking the previous one, multiplying it by 252533, and then keeping the remainder from dividing that value by 33554393.\n\nSo, to find the second code (which ends up in row 2, column 1), start with the previous value, 20151125. Multiply it by 252533 to get 5088824049625. Then, divide that by 33554393, which leaves a remainder of 31916031. That remainder is the second code.\n\n\"Oh!\", says the voice. \"It looks like we missed a scrap from one of the manuals.
